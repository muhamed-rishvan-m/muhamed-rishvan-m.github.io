      <h2>Brief Introduction of Electric Vehicles (EVs)</h2>
      <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) represent a transformative shift in the global automotive industry. By replacing traditional internal combustion engines with electric motors powered by rechargeable batteries, EVs provide a sustainable alternative that significantly reduces carbon emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. As governments and individuals worldwide become more environmentally conscious, EVs have gained momentum in various sectors, from personal commuting to public transport.</p>
      <p>The adoption of EVs is not just a trend; it’s a necessity in combating climate change. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the transportation sector accounts for a significant percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions. Transitioning to electric vehicles is essential for reducing air pollution, particularly in densely populated urban areas. Moreover, advancements in battery technology have led to increased energy density, resulting in longer ranges and shorter charging times for EVs, making them more appealing to consumers.</p>
      <p>In recent years, India has emerged as a significant market for EVs, with both government and private sector initiatives supporting the transition to cleaner mobility options. The Indian government has introduced various incentives, including subsidies and tax exemptions, to encourage EV adoption. Furthermore, the expansion of charging infrastructure is a priority, addressing one of the major barriers to EV ownership. With rapidly growing urbanization, improving EV infrastructure, and a push toward renewable energy integration, electric vehicles are expected to play a pivotal role in reshaping India's transportation landscape.</p>
      <p>EVs are categorized into several types: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). Each type has its unique advantages and contributes to the overall goal of sustainable transportation.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>Global Electric Vehicle Usage by Country</h2>
      <p>The adoption of electric vehicles varies significantly across countries, influenced by government policies, infrastructure availability, and environmental priorities. Here’s a look at EV usage rates in top countries around the world:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Norway:</strong> Over 86% of all new cars sold in Norway are electric, making it the global leader in EV adoption per capita. Norway’s aggressive policies, including tax exemptions and extensive charging infrastructure, contribute to this high rate.</li>
        <li><strong>China:</strong> The world’s largest EV market, with EVs accounting for 20% of new car sales. China has more than 50% of the global EV fleet, thanks to large-scale government support and incentives for both consumers and manufacturers.</li>
        <li><strong>Germany:</strong> EVs represent about 15% of new car sales. Germany’s commitment to green mobility is evident in its rapidly expanding charging network and subsidies for electric car buyers.</li>
        <li><strong>United States:</strong> Around 7% of new car sales are electric, with California leading the way. Federal tax credits and state-level incentives have spurred EV adoption, especially in environmentally conscious regions.</li>
        <li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> EVs make up about 12% of new car sales, with ambitious goals to ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. Government incentives and a robust charging network support this transition.</li>
        <li><strong>France:</strong> Approximately 10% of new car sales are electric. France offers incentives for EV purchases and actively promotes a green transportation agenda.</li>
        <li><strong>Netherlands:</strong> EVs account for 25% of new car sales, supported by extensive charging infrastructure and favorable tax policies.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>These statistics highlight the global shift towards sustainable transportation, driven by a combination of government incentives, technological advancements, and growing public awareness about the environment. As countries continue to set ambitious climate targets, EV adoption rates are expected to climb even higher worldwide.</p>

      <h2>Our Innovation Ideas for EV Improvement</h2>
      <p>We propose several innovative ideas aimed at improving the efficiency and user experience of electric vehicles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solar Panels Integration:</strong> By incorporating solar panels into EVs, drivers can harness supplementary energy from the sun, thereby extending the driving range and reducing dependency on charging infrastructure. This is particularly beneficial in regions with abundant sunlight.</li>
        <li><strong>Lightweight Core Structure:</strong> Using advanced lightweight materials in EV construction reduces the vehicle's weight, improving efficiency as less energy is required for movement. This can also enhance acceleration and handling.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Charging Solutions:</strong> Developing smart charging stations equipped with AI that can optimize charging schedules based on grid demand and energy prices, ensuring users benefit from cost-effective charging options.</li>
        <li><strong>Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Technology:</strong> Implementing V2G systems that allow EVs to return energy to the grid during peak demand times, providing additional income streams for EV owners and stabilizing the power grid.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Battery Recycling Programs:</strong> Establishing robust recycling programs to repurpose and recycle EV batteries, reducing waste and creating a sustainable lifecycle for EV components.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Charging Networks:</strong> Creating local community charging stations that allow EV owners to share charging points, making EV use more accessible in areas with limited infrastructure.</li>
